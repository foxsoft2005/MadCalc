# MadCalc
The simple calculation system that can be extended by plugins. Main idea is to make possible to perform <b>any</b> calculation from one place.

You can try 2 available calculators (plugins) at the moment:

<b>SimpleCalc</b>

This is the simple calculator without standard GUI. So, you just need to enter your expression to perform calculation.

<b>CreditCalc</b>

This is the simple credit calculator. You need to enter some settings (amount, precent rate, duration) in order to perform calculation.

<b>P.S.</b> I want to add some new calculators for that system. Feel free to propose :).
